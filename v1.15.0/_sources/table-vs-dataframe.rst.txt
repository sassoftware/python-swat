***************************************
CASTable vs. DataFrame vs. SASDataFrame
***************************************

:class:`CASTable` objects and DataFrame object (either :class:`pandas.DataFrame` or 
:class:`SASDataFrame`) act very similar in many ways, but they are extremely different
constructs.  :class:`CASTable` objects do not contain actual data.  They are simply
a client-side view of the data in a CAS table on a CAS server.  DataFrames and 
SASDataFrames contain data in-memory on the client machine.

Since these objects work very much the same way, it can be a little confusing when
you start to work with them.  The rule to remember is that if the type of the object
contains "DataFrame" (i.e., DataFrame or SASDataFrame), the data is local.  If the
type of the object contains "Table" or "Column" (i.e., CASTable or CASColumn), it is
a client-side view of the data in a CAS table on the server.

Even though they are very different architectures, :class:`CASTable` objects support
much of the :class:`pandas.DataFrame` API.  However, since CAS tables can contain
enormous amounts of data that wouldn't fit into the memory of a single machine, there
are some differences in the way the APIs work.  The basic rules to remember 
about :class:`CASTable` data access are as follows.

    * If a method returns observation-level data, it will be returned as a new
      :class:`CASTable` object.
    * If a method returns summarized data, it will return data as a :class:`SASDataFrame`.

In other words, if the method is going to return a new data set with potentially 
huge amounts of data, you will get a new :class:`CASTable` object that is a view of that
data.  If the method is going to compute a result of some analysis that is a summary
of the data, you will get a local copy of that result in a :class:`SASDataFrame`.
Most actions allow you to specify a ``casout=`` parameter that allows you to send the
summarized data to a table in the server as well.

The methods and properties of :class:`CASTable` objects that return a new :class:`CASTable`
object are ``loc``, ``iloc``, ``ix``, ``query``, ``sort_values``, and ``__getitem__`` 
(i.e., ``tbl[...]``).  The remaining methods will return results.
A sampling of a number of methods common to both :class:`CASTable` and
DataFrame are shown below with the result type of that method.

============  ==========   =========
Method        CASTable     DataFrame
============  ==========   =========
o.head()      DataFrame    DataFrame
o.describe()  DataFrame    DataFrame
o['col']      CASColumn    Series
o[['col']]    CASTable     DataFrame
o.summary()   CASResults   N/A
============  ==========   =========

In the table above, the :class:`CASColumn` is a subclass of :class:`CASTable`
that only references a single column of the CAS table.

The last entry in the table above is a call to a CAS action called ``summary``.
All CAS actions return a :class:`CASResults` object (which is a subclass of 
Python's ordered dictionary).  DataFrame's can not call CAS actions, although
you can upload a DataFrame to a CAS table using the :meth:`CAS.upload` method.

It is possible to convert all of the data from a CAS table into a DataFrame by
using the :meth:`CASTable.to_frame` method, however, you do need to be careful.
It will attempt to pull all of the data down regardless of size.

:class:`CASColumn` objects work much in the same was as :class:`CASTable` objects
except that they operate on a single column of data like a :class:`pandas.Series`.

============  =========  =========
Method        CASColumn  Series
============  =========  =========
c.head()      Series     Series
c[c.col > 1]  CASColumn  Series
============  =========  =========

Pandas DataFrame vs. SASDataFrame
=================================

:class:`SASDataFrame` is a subclass of :class:`pandas.DataFrame`.  Therefore, anything
you can do with a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` will also work with :class:`SASDataFrame`.
The only difference is that :class:`SASDataFrame` objects contain extra metadata
familiar to SAS users.  This includes a title, label, name, a dictionary of extended
attributes for information such as By groups and system titles (``attrs``), and 
a dictionary of column metadata (``colinfo``).

Also, since SAS has both formatted and raw values for By groups, :class:`SASDataFrame` 
objects also have a method called :meth:`SASDataFrame.reshape_bygroups` to change
the way that By group information in represented in the DataFrame.  See the 
:ref:`By group documentation <bygroups>` for more information.
