The SWAT client includes two pieces each of which uses a separate
license.  The Python code is open-sourced and uses the standard
`Apache 2.0 license <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_.
This code can be used to access CAS using the REST interface only.

To use the binary CAS interface, you also need the SAS TK 
runtime libraries and the Python extensions compiled against
them. These come bundled in the platform-specific installers for
SWAT and are released under SAS' additional functionality license
(shown below).

Customer agree to comply with these and other applicable export and
import laws and regulations. Customer's compliance obligations include
ensuring (a) that there is no access, download, export, re-export,
import, or distribution of the Code or any underlying information,
technology or data except in full compliance with all laws and
regulations of the United States and in full compliance with any other
applicable laws and regulations; and (b) compliance with restrictions of
countries other than the United States related to exports and imports.
United States export classification information for Software can be

Agreement and using and/or, if authorized, downloading the Code,
Customer agrees to the foregoing and represents and warrants that
(i) neither Customer nor any User, as defined in the Software License
Agreement, is a party to whom the United States prohibits access to the
Code; (ii) neither Customer nor any User is located in, under control

Source code from which the Code object code is derived ("Source Code")
is not being provided and is a SAS trade secret to which access is not
authorized. Customer may not reverse assemble, reverse engineer, or
decompile the Code or otherwise attempt to recreate the Source Code,
except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such
restriction.

Upon termination of the license to use the Software, Customer agrees
to delete and destroy the Code and certify to SAS that the Code has
been deleted and destroyed.
