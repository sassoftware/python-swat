Troubleshooting

Just as with any authenticated network service, you may run into problems
from time to time while connecting to CAS.  These are some of the more
common problems you may run across.

Unable to Connect
=================

There are various reasons that you may not be able to connect to your CAS
server.  You may have an incorrect hostname or port number.  There may be
a firewall preventing you from reaching the CAS server.  Not being able
to connect to a server will result in a error that looks like the following.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS(hostname, port)

   . . .

   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     File "swat/cas/connection.py", line 297, in __init__
       raise SWATError(self._sw_error.getLastErrorMessage())
   swat.exceptions.SWATError: Could not connect to 'my-cas' on port 5570.

If you have verified that the server is running on that host and port, and 
that you are not being blocked, another possible reason for failure to connect
is that the CAS server may be configured to use encrypted communication.
For information on how to configure the Python SWAT client to communicate
with CAS servers over encrypted connections, see :ref:`encryption`.

.. note:: Beginning in SAS Viya 3.3, encrypted communication is enabled
          in the server by default.


Missing Linux Library Dependencies
==================================

SWAT uses various shared libraries commonly available on Linux machines.
If you are missing a shared library that SWAT requires, you may see a message
such as the following when creating a CAS connection.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS(hostname, port)
   tkBoot failed:  Cannot dlopen [tkmk.so] : [libnuma.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory]

This particular error can be solved by installing the ``numactl`` package of
your Linux distribution.  If you do not have system administrator privileges,
you can set an environment variable ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to the location of
a copy of ``libnuma.so.1``.  However, it is recommended that you contact your system
administrator to install this library so that it will receive regular updates
with the system.


Incorrect SAS TK Configuration
==============================

The following error can occur if you do not have the SAS TK system properly 
configured.  Normally, the correct TK settings are applied when SWAT is loaded.
However, if you are using an installation of the libraries in a separate
directory, you may get errors if the correct files are not in that directory.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS(hostname, port)
   tkBoot failed:  Cannot Locate [tkmk] in [/usr/local/lib/swat-tk:/opt/sas/viya/SASFoundation/sasexe/:
   Could not get TK handle

   SWATError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

                             locale, nworkers, name, authinfo, protocol, **kwargs)
       225                 self._sw_error = clib.SW_CASError(a2n(soptions))
       226         except SystemError:
   --> 227             raise SWATError('Could not create CAS object. Check your TK path setting.')
       228 
       229         # Make the connection
   
   SWATError: Could not create CAS object. Check your TK path setting.

To fix this issue, make sure that ``swat.options.tkpath`` is set to the location of the
SAS TK libraries.


Unable to Import _pyXXswat
==========================

If you are creating a CAS connection and you get the following error, it 
generally means that you don't have the SAS TK libraries or the Python
extension installed.  This can happen if you only installed the Python
source version of SWAT (not the installer that bundles the SAS TK 
libraries) and you tried to connect to CAS using the binary protocol.

The source-only Python installer can only connect to the REST interface of
CAS, so you must point :class:`CAS` to a REST port rather than a binary
port.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS(hostname, port)
   
   . . .
   
   During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

       224             else:
   --> 225                 self._sw_error = clib.SW_CASError(a2n(soptions))
       226         except SystemError:

Refused Connection
==================

If you get an error saying that the connection was refused, you probably do not 
a CAS server running on that host or port, or you are behind a firewall that is
preventing your from accessing that server.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS('my-cas', 12345)
   ERROR: The TCP/IP tcpSockConnect support routine failed with error 61 (The connection was refused.).
   ERROR: Failed to connect to host 'my-cas', port 12345.
   
   . . .
   
   During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
   
   SWATError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
   <ipython-input-3-404a7919d58a> in <module>()
   ----> 1 conn = swat.CAS('my-cas', 12345)
   
   cas/connection.py in __init__(self, hostname, port, username, password, session,
                                 locale, nworkers, name, authinfo, protocol, **kwargs)
       259                     raise SystemError
       260         except SystemError:
   --> 261             raise SWATError(self._sw_error.getLastErrorMessage())
       262 
       263         errorcheck(self._sw_connection.setZeroIndexedParameters(), self._sw_connection)
   
   SWATError: Could not connect to 'my-cas' on port 12345.


Authentication Issues
=====================

Authentication problems can occur for many reasons.  The examples below show 
two possible issues.  The first one is an issue with the Authinfo file that
contains the passwords.  It requires the file permissions to be readable by
the owner only.  In this case, the Authinfo file was readable by others, 
which is invalid.

Other issues that can occur with an Authinfo file include not having a 
hostname and port that matches the one used in the :class:`CAS` constructor
or simply having the incorrect (possibly outdated) password in the file.
The second code sample below shows the error for an incorrect password.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS('my-cas', 12345)
   WARNING: Incorrect permissions on netrc/authinfo file.
   ERROR: Kerberos initialization failed. Your credential cache is either expired or missing.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
   connection.py in__init__(self, hostname, port, username, password, session,
                            locale, nworkers, name, authinfo, protocol, **kwargs)
       256                                                                 a2n(soptions),
   --> 257                                                                 self._sw_error)
       258                 if self._sw_connection is None:
   
   . . .
   
   SWATError: Could not connect to 'my-cas' on port 12345.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: conn = swat.CAS('my-cas', 12345)
   ERROR: Connection failed. Server returned: Authentication failed: Access denied.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             locale, nworkers, name, authinfo, protocol, **kwargs)
       256                                                                 a2n(soptions),
   --> 257                                                                 self._sw_error)
       258                 if self._sw_connection is None:
   
   . . .
       
   SWATError: Could not connect to 'my-cas' on port 12345.


UnicodeEncodeError in Windows Console
=====================================

If you attempt to print content from a CAS action that contains UTF-8 encoded 
characters, you may encounter an error like the following:

.. code-block:: python

   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     File "c:\anaconda3\lib\encodings\cp437.py", line 19, in encode
       return codecs.charmap_encode(input,self.errors,encoding_map)[0]
   UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 525-526: character maps to <undefined>

This can happen if the encoding in your Windows console is set to an encoding
that can't handle the characters in the CAS output.  There are a few solutions
to this issue.

   1.  Upgrade to Python 3.6.  Python 3.6 includes a fix that will allow the 
       characters to be displayed properly.
   2.  Run 'chcp 65001' in the console before executing your Python code.  This
       will change the codepage in the console to one that will support the
       characters.
   3.  Install the `win-unicode-console <https://github.com/Drekin/win-unicode-console>`_
       package and follow the instructions to enable it.
