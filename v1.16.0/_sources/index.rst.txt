The **SAS SWAT** package is a Python interface to **SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS)** 
(the centerpiece of the `SAS Viya <http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya.html>`__ framework).
With this package, you can load and analyze 
data sets of any size on your desktop or in the cloud.  Since CAS can be used on a local
desktop or in a hosted cloud environment, you can analyze extremely large data sets using
as much processing power as you need, while still retaining the ease-of-use of Python
on the client side.

Using SWAT, you can execute workflows of CAS analytic actions, then pull down
the summarized data to further process on the client side in Python, or to merge with data
from other sources using familiar `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`__ data structures.  In fact,
the SWAT package mimics much of the API of the Pandas package so that using CAS should
feel familiar to current Pandas users.

With the best-of-breed SAS analytics in the cloud and the use of Python and 
its large collection of open source packages, the SWAT package gives you access
to the best of both worlds.
