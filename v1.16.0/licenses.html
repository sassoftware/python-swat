<p>The SWAT client includes two pieces each of which uses a separate
license.  The Python code is open-sourced and uses the standard
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.
This code can be used to access CAS using the REST interface only.</p>
<p>To use the binary CAS interface, you also need the SAS TK
runtime libraries and the Python extensions compiled against
them. These come bundled in the platform-specific installers for
SWAT and are released under SAS’ additional functionality license
(shown below).</p>

<h2>SAS License Agreement for Corrective Code or Additional Functionality<a class="headerlink" href="#sas-license-agreement-for-corrective-code-or-additional-functionality" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT
(“AGREEMENT”). BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR USING THE CODE, AS
DEFINED BELOW, YOU, ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMER, AS DEFINED BELOW, ARE AGREEING
TO THESE TERMS AND SAS, AS DEFINED BELOW, WILL AUTHORIZE YOU TO DOWNLOAD
THE CODE. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO
BIND CUSTOMER TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT OR ATTEMPT TO DOWNLOAD
THE CODE.</p>
<p>You are downloading software code (“Code”) which will become part of
a software product (“Software”) that is currently licensed from SAS
Institute Inc. or one of its subsidiaries (“SAS”) under a separate
software license agreement (“Software License Agreement”). The legal
entity that entered into the Software License Agreement with SAS is
defined as “Customer.” The Code is designed either to correct an error
in the Software or to add functionality to the Software. The Code is
governed by the Software License Agreement and this Agreement. If you
are not an authorized user under the Software License Agreement, you may
not download the Code.</p>
<p>In addition to the terms of the Software License Agreement, the
following terms apply to the Code:</p>
<p>EXPORT/IMPORT RESTRICTIONS. SAS hereby notifies Customer that the Code
is of United States of America (“United States”) origin and United
States export laws and regulations apply to the Code. Both SAS and
Customer agree to comply with these and other applicable export and
import laws and regulations. Customer’s compliance obligations include
ensuring (a) that there is no access, download, export, re-export,
import, or distribution of the Code or any underlying information,
technology or data except in full compliance with all laws and
regulations of the United States and in full compliance with any other
applicable laws and regulations; and (b) compliance with restrictions of
countries other than the United States related to exports and imports.
United States export classification information for Software can be
found at SAS’ Export Compliance website located at
<a class="reference external" href="http://support.sas.com/adminservices/export.html">http://support.sas.com/adminservices/export.html</a>. By accepting the
Agreement and using and/or, if authorized, downloading the Code,
Customer agrees to the foregoing and represents and warrants that
(i) neither Customer nor any User, as defined in the Software License
Agreement, is a party to whom the United States prohibits access to the
Code; (ii) neither Customer nor any User is located in, under control
of, or a national or resident of any country to which export of the
Code is restricted by laws of the United States or other applicable
laws and regulations, including E:1 countries (currently Cuba, Iran,
North Korea, Syria, and Sudan); (iii) neither Customer nor any User
will use the Code in activities directly or indirectly related to the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; (iv) neither Customer nor
any User will share access to the Code with a party identified in this
paragraph; and (v) neither Customer nor any User shall further export
the Code without a license or other authorization from the United States.</p>
<p>Source code from which the Code object code is derived (“Source Code”)
is not being provided and is a SAS trade secret to which access is not
authorized. Customer may not reverse assemble, reverse engineer, or
decompile the Code or otherwise attempt to recreate the Source Code,
except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such
restriction.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the license to use the Software, Customer agrees
to delete and destroy the Code and certify to SAS that the Code has
been deleted and destroyed.</p>
<p>SAS’ LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ARISING AS A RESULT OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN
THE TRADE OR BY COURSE OF DEALING. SAS’ LICENSORS PROVIDE THEIR
SOFTWARE “AS IS.”</p>
<p>SAS’ LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR CUSTOMER FOR ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR CODE.</p>
<p>Customer agrees not to release the results of any benchmarking you
perform on the Code or the Software.</p>
